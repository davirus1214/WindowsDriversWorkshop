# Windows Drivers Workshop

This workshop is possible thanks to the collaboration of [Costa Rica Tech (TEC)](https://www.tec.ac.cr/) and [Intel](https://www.intel.la/content/www/xl/es/corporate-responsibility/intel-in-costa-rica.html).

The present repository contains the samples, documents, and presentations presented in the Windows Drivers Workshop v1. Each of the drivers shown is a Kernel-mode driver designed to run on Windows 10 or Windows 11.

This workshop is designed to introduce the development of Kernel-mode drivers for Windows. The workshop is divided into 7 classes, each with a duration of 3 hours. The classes are designed to be practical, with the development of a driver in each class. The classes are designed to be taken in order, as each class builds on the previous one.

You can watch the classes in Spanish [here](https://tecnube1-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/itrejos_itcr_ac_cr/EhOOuuxp9XNFlwAyIZXC7L8BKrxlmYipIZV7kMHNrsBpXg?e=8iq0IQ).
