# Windows Drivers Workshop

This workshop is possible thanks to the collaboration of [Costa Rica Tech (TEC)](https://www.tec.ac.cr/) and [Intel](https://www.intel.la/content/www/xl/es/corporate-responsibility/intel-in-costa-rica.html).

The present repository contains the samples, documents, and presentations presented in the Windows Drivers Workshop v1. Each of the drivers shown is a Kernel-mode driver designed to run on Windows 10 or Windows 11.

This workshop is designed to introduce the development of Kernel-mode drivers for Windows. The workshop is divided into 7 classes, each with a duration of 3 hours. The classes are designed to be practical, with the development of a driver in each class. The classes are designed to be taken in order, as each class builds on the previous one.

You can watch the classes in Spanish [here](https://tecnube1-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/itrejos_itcr_ac_cr/EhOOuuxp9XNFlwAyIZXC7L8BKrxlmYipIZV7kMHNrsBpXg?e=8iq0IQ).

## Visual Studio 2022

Microsoft officialy supports driver development with Visual Studio. For this, you will need to install Visual Studio 2022 with the latest updates.

* Make sure the C++ workload is selected during installation.

## Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)

The following link contains the necessary steps to set up the development environment for driver creation. Within the steps, you will find links to download the SDK(Windows Software Development Kit) and WDK(Windows Driver Kit), along with some additional installations required in Visual Studio. 

It is important to ensure that the versions of the SDK (Windows Software Development Kit) and the WDK (Windows Driver Kit) match for them to work together correctly. Using incompatible versions can cause issues during driver development and compilation.
