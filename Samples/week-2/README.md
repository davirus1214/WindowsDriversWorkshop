# KMDF Hello World Windows Driver

This driver sample is a modification of the [HelloWorld](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/writing-a-very-small-kmdf--driver) example. It is a simple kernel-mode driver that prints a message when it is loaded. 

For a step-by-step guide on how to implement this driver, refer to [Task 1](https://github.com/davirus1214/WindowsDriversWorkshop/blob/main/Documents/Tasks/Task_1_Windows_Drivers_Workshop.md) of the Windows Drivers Workshop.
